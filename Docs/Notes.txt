Probe Repeatability Exercise notes:

-- Inter subject variablity (standard deviation in digitized probe positions) is shown in the Inter-Subject variation option with color - from purple (least variation) to yellow (most variation). 

-- The Probe Fabrication Error option also shows inter subject variablity but instead of using color, it uses ellipse size and shape to show inter-subject variability - the bigger the ellipse in 
the x or y the gretaer the variability in that direction. In addtion to the inter-subject varibility Probe Fabrication Error uses color to show how far the mean subject optiode position is from 
the design. The design poaition is shown by the black dot


How to improve tool Inter-Subject Variability:

-- Need to be able to make short separation optodes in the main gui hidden. 

-- Make single gui with rotation buttons, which will have 3 head displays which would 
rotate synchronously: the two current displays which are at present in separate figures, 
Digitized Probe Positions and Standard Deviation across Digitized Probes and a 3rd axes 
with mean positions design probe.

-- GUI would also contain the optode pos table

-- Would be useful feature in AV twhen displaying ref points letters to control the font size. 
-- In AV File menu, change menu option name Change Subject to Change Group to bring it in line 
with Homer3

v2.13.2

-- Add hide landmarks checkbox to probe panel, to first show if landmarks exist at all at a glance by enabling it and then where they are by unchecking it. 
-- Fix probe and refpts 'name' field that was used to propagate the same probe to all subjects in the group folder with a cell array of names. I backed out this change but not sure why.
